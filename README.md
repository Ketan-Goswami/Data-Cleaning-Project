# Data-Cleaning-Project
This is a data cleaning project that I carried out purely using MySQL on the Tech layoffs dataset from COVID 2019 to late 2022 consisting of nearly 8000 columns.
This project involved the use of basic MySQL queries from create, select, describe, insert, various JOINS to advanced Window Functions, Procedures, CTEs, Triggers and Events.
This repository not only contains the project file but also with all the other MySQL queries.
